## **How This Works:**

### **1. Pre-Loading (No Hanging)**
- All farmland objects spawn at game start (hidden)
- No mid-game creation causing performance spikes

### **2. Transition Zone (200 units)**
```
Distance:  800 --------- 1000 --------- 1200
           City    Transition   Farmland

Progress:  0% ---------- 100% ----------
           City fades    Farmland fades
           out slowly    in slowly

## **What This Adds:**

### **Farmland Biome Objects:**

1. **Barns** - Red buildings with triangular roofs and white cross
2. **Silos** - Silver cylindrical grain silos with dome tops
3. **Windmills** - White towers with rotating 3-blade turbines
4. **Crop Fields** - Rows of golden wheat/corn
5. **Wooden Fences** - Brown fence posts along fields
6. **Hay Bales** - Golden cylindrical bales with straps

### **Biome System:**

- **Switches every 1000 distance units** (~1 kilometer)
- **Alternates**: City → Farmland → City → Farmland...
- **City scenery hidden** when in farmland (trees, houses, bushes)
- **Farmland scenery hidden** when in city

### **Visual Changes:**

**City Mode:**
- Dark night sky (0x0a0a1a)
- Street lamps, houses, trees, bushes
- Urban atmosphere

**Farmland Mode:**
- Lighter green-brown sky (0x87a96b)
- Farms, silos, windmills, crops, fences
- Rural atmosphere
- Windmills rotate continuously
- Crops gently sway

### **Transitions:**

- **3-second notification**: "ENTERING FARMLAND" or "ENTERING CITY"
- **Smooth fade** animation
- **Sky color change**
- **Scenery swap** (instant toggle for performance)

### **Player Experience:**
```
